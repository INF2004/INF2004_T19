# INF2004_T19

SIT INF2004 (Embedded Systems): C Program for a robot car with the following components:
- RP 2040 Pico W
- Magnetomer (Control the direction of the car)
- 2 Motors (1 each for left and right wheel)
- L298 Motor controller
- IR Sensor (Sidewall detection)
- Ultrasonic Sensor (Obstacle detection)
- Barcode detection and decode (Barcode detection along the maze)
- 2 wheels
- 2 Encoders (1 for each wheel, PID Speed regulator for both wheels to turn at the same time)

# Workload distribution for the team

Same as the project proposal submitted with some minor changes, the respective team members split the work equally and did the following:

| Working directory  | Done By |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Ultrasonic sensor (Distance measurement)
-	Calculate distance based on time taken for sound waves to bounce back after hitting an object  | Amanda  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
